## Why is it important?

-   If you're looking to build a startup, understanding where to begin your startup may be important based off the industry you're in.
-   Successful can mean many things. It can mean being operated and become a series C or higher startup. Maybe you want to build a company that IPO or accquired. Are there specific industries or locations where you can find your success?
-   What investors could be important to your business?

## Notes:

-   We've filtered our data to look at USA locations
-   We're only looking at data from companies who have had their last funding round between 2013 and 2015.
-   Reason: Investor patterns change quite rapidly and what made a company successful five years ago doesn't neccesarily mean much for your success now (if we were living in 2015/2016)
